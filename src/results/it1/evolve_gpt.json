Your environment consists of different areas with varying lighting conditions: a room with a narrow beam of light and a room with uniform lighting. You have tools such as a magnifying glass and a light meter, which can be used to study the dust particles. The magnifying glass can be used to examine dust in detail, while the light meter measures light intensity. However, the magnifying glass becomes ineffective after examining a certain number of particles.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n- **move <start_location> <end_location> <scientist>**: This action allows the scientist to move from one room to another if access is available between the rooms. The effect of this action is that the scientist is no longer at the start location but is now at the end location.\n- **use_magnifying_glass <location> <magnifying_glass> <scientist> <dust_particle>**: This action allows the scientist to use the magnifying glass to study a dust particle at their current location. The precondition for this action is that both the scientist and the dust particle are at the same location.
