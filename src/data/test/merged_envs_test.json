The effect of this action is that the spanner is no longer at that location, and the man is now carrying the spanner.\n- **tighten_nut <location> <spanner> <man> <nut>**: This action allows the man to tighten a loose nut at his current location using a spanner he is carrying. The preconditions for this action are that the man, the nut, and the spanner are all at the same location, the spanner is usable, and the nut is loose.
